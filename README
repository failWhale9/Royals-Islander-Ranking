This project serves to provide ranking data and other information to Islanders of MapleRoyals. 

Files:
islanders.json - Contains data for each Islander
badges.json - Contains information for earnable badges
islander.css - Style sheet for the entire site
index.html - main ranking table
badges.html - page that lists all badges
unranked.html - page for unranked islanders (banned, deleted, boated, opt-out)

To add an islander, create a new entry in islanders.json like this:

  {
    "Name": "Examplander",            // The character's in-game name, case-sensitive
    "Level": "31",                    // The character's last known level
    "Alias": "1lander, 2lander",      // If the character underwent any name changes, list the old names here
    "BadNews": "Banned - mod sass",   // This property moves the character to the unranked list (use this if they are banned, deleted, left the island, or opted out of rankings)              
    "Alt": "ExamplBoat",              // If this character is a known alt, put the main's name here
    "Badges":["meso2b","gomu4"]       // Any earned badges go here. See badges.json and use the id.
  },

  You should also add a character image to the images/islanders directory, with the name of the islander as the filename, all lowercase (e.g. examplander.png).
